Let me synthesize the key themes and write the article about setting up n8n for AI-native automation.
Key themes from your writing:
"so you can vibe" - AI-native velocity is real, but enterprise discipline isn't optional. Foundation to integration in 30 days. "Move fast because we've designed systems that let us know when they are broken."
"surrender is the new reality" - Old patterns assume humans are the bottleneck. AI inverts this. Three patterns that hurt: quality as final checkpoint, governance as permission, documentation as artifact. Documentation IS the build instruction now.
"remember why it worked" - Principles haven't expired. We built specs to align humans; now we build specs to align models. ADRs are now context windows. Encode senior engineer judgment into system prompts, linting rules, quality-specific MCP servers.
"design your assistants" - AI tools are exactly as effective as the clarity of their instructions. Train them like a high-performing team. Document everything an assistant needs to think about your system the way you do.
Your style: Direct, no fluff. Bullet points with punch. Short paragraphs. "See you in production, {k}" signature. TL;DR up front. Practical with a philosophical edge.

What I captured from your style:
TL;DR up front
Direct, no fluff
Short paragraphs with punch
Bullet points and tables for clarity
Practical code examples
Your signature "See you in production, {k}"
The philosophical edge: "That excuse is gone"
Key themes woven in:
Documentation as build instruction (not artifact)
Design for assistants to be effective
AI-native velocity with enterprise discipline
Move fast because systems tell us when broken
Actions not workflows (discrete, testable, observable)
