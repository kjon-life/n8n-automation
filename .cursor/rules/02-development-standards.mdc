# Development Standards - MANDATORY

## BRANCH & COMMIT - MANDATORY FORMATS
- Branch format: `feature/YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description` or `fix/YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description`
- Commit format: `type(scope): subject` (conventional commits)
- Every commit must be atomic (single logical change)
- Never commit broken code or failing tests

## SECURITY - NO EXCEPTIONS
- NEVER hardcode secrets, API keys, or credentials in code
- ALWAYS sanitize all user inputs before processing
- EVERY external API call MUST include timeout and retry limits
- ALWAYS use environment variables for configuration

## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT - MANDATORY
- HTTP Request nodes: always set timeout (default 30s, max 300s)
- Large datasets: use pagination or Split In Batches node
- External APIs: respect rate limits, add Wait nodes between calls if needed
- Code nodes: avoid unbounded loops or recursive calls

## FORBIDDEN PATTERNS
- NO generic error messages without specific context
- NO hardcoded configuration values
- NO commits with FIXME comments
- NO logging of sensitive data

## WORKFLOW STANDARDS
- Workflow names: lowercase-kebab-case (e.g., `job-hunter-discovery`)
- Node names: describe what it does, not what it is (e.g., "Filter New Jobs" not "Code1")
- Credentials: use n8n credential system, never hardcode in nodes
- Always add Error Trigger workflow for production workflows

## PRE-COMMIT REQUIREMENTS
Before any commit or PR:
- Documentation updated for public interface changes
- No secrets or credentials in code
- Workflow exports tested (if applicable)
